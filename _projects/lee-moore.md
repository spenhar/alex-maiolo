It might seem unusual for a person who has dedicated his life to The Arts to choose insurance as a career, but itâ€™s a case of catering to a need. In our culture rich community of Carrboro and Chapel Hill we have lawyers who came out of the Indie Rock scene, and an accountant who used to be a Goth. The woman who sold me my house is a Jazz singer. Yet nobody was tending to the insurance component, even though it is something we all have to deal with, regardless of our pursuits. I started my agency and brokerage to serve my tribe, and for almost two decades now, record labels, recording studios, design firms, art galleries, creatives, unique restaurateurs, brewers, and distillers have had an option to work with someone who speaks their language.
