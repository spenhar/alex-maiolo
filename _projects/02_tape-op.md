Tape Op may be known as the most widely read magazine in the world, but it’s more than that. It’s less of a technical periodical, and more of an ongoing project to document the stories of how some of the greatest music ever made was created. Every writer is encouraged to use their own voice and, after 20 years, the magazine remains independently owned, staunchly DIY, deeply respected, and more relevant than ever specifically because of that. My role has been advisor and journalist, primarily focusing on articles requiring deep research, or those that focus on Northern Europe, specifically Scandinavia.
