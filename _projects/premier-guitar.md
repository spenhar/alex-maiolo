I was approached by Premier Guitar to contribute because they have always strived to be an alternative to the other guitar periodicals. They were looking for writers who understood that it was time to move past the Blues-based Boys Club these magazines inherently are. Iâ€™ve focused primarily on iconoclastic gear builders and Psychedelic music. 60,000 print issues are mailed, and the website reaches 1.5 million unique readers per month.
