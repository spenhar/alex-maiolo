Reverb.com is an online music gear marketplace that designed to address the fact that the Ebay exprience had become frustrating. Interviews and tutorials were added to make the experience even better. I was approached to contribute based on my work with Tape Op and Premier Guitar, and given carte blanche to pursue content. My focus has been primarily on Electronic Music, and tutorials. In 2016 I was asked to expand my focus into Europe.
