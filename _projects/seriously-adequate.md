Consumer equipment made it possible for me to start recording as a teenager, in 1983, but a major paradigm shift in technology, and the music industry itself, leveled the field for DIY recordists, starting around 2001. I built Seriously Adequate with the goal of creating an affordable space, for musicians who need my help with engineering and production, or who can work on their own. Credits include releases ranging from Chamber Pop to Metal.
